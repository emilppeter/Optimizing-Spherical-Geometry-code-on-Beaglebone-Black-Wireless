# Optimizing-Spherical-Geometry-code-on-Beaglebone-Black-Wireless
A program to calculate closest weather station to each of the state capitals,using ARM Cortex A8 based Beaglebone black wireless board,is optimized for speed.Cosine approximations with different accuracies were used and the improvement in execution time was studied while at the same time outputs obtained were validated against those obtained using library defined double precision cosine function. Appropriate cosine approximation was chosen after considering the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Also a 2-pass method is implemented wherein inaccurate fastest cosine approximation is used to filter out distant points in first pass and the closest point was selected from a set of apparent closest points using much accurate but slower cosine approximation in second pass. The operating system used on beaglebone black was debian linux.
